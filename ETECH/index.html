            <h2>Philippines Ranked Fourth Most Corrupt in Asia-Pacific</h2>
            <p>
              According to a survey by the Hong Kong-based Political & Economic Risk Consultancy released in 2010, the Philippines ranked as the 4th most corrupt out of 16 major Asia-Pacific investment destinations. The Philippines ranked as the first most corrupt during 2008 and placed 6th in 2009, with a score of 7.0.
              
              This survey of Hong Kong's PERC polled 2,714 middle, senior, and expatriate business executives in Asia, Australia, and the United States.
              
              The survey states how corruption affects a country's government. The survey also shows how difficult it is to deal with corruption, especially since the corrupt people are somehow the people who are leading the country. Examples are politicians and civil servants. The lower the score the less chance of the country being corrupt. Higher scores may hint that the people who are leading the country may be corrupt.

            <h2>Philippine Government Deals Overpriced by 20 Percent because of Corruption</h2>
            <p>A former senior state official told a Senate inquiry into corruption that contracts with the Philippine government are usually overpriced by at least 20 percent to facilitate kickbacks. Manny Mogato of Reuters wrote: "In emotional evidence, Rodolfo Lozada repeated previous allegations that the Philippines's top election officer claimed $ 130 million when she was cut for a final $ 329 million telecommunications with China's ZTE, double
              the usual reback." (Mogato, 2008).
              
              Lozada then stated that " The whole problem began when the chairman Abalos wanted to protect $ 130 million in the project." He then pointed out that it was too high and suggested another price. But later on, he was forced to resign as election commissioner.

            <h2>Philippine National Police: The Philippines most corrupt agency</h2>
            <p>According to a survey by the Global Corruption Barometer of the anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, the most corrupt institution in the Philippines is the Philippine National Police. The survey covered approximately 114,000 respondents in 107 countries, with 69% of the respondents voting for the PNP as the most corrupt (Romero, 2013).

              Low salaries of cops are deemed to be the leading cause of police corruption. Joel D. Adriano stated in Asia Times that,  “Salaries of cops are not commensurate with the risks they face. A low-ranking police officer makes only 12,500 pesos (US$290) a month and approximately 60 percent of the police force is estimated to live below the poverty line. Many live in squatter settlements and cannot afford to send their children to school, according to a recent study by the University of the Philippines and the CORPS Foundation. Half of the police officers they surveyed said that they have no bank savings. Lean economics "leaves members of the police force vulnerable to corruption, bribery, and criminal activities", according to Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a global consulting firm.
