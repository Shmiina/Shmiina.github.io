                <h3> 
                    According to a survey by the Global Corruption Barometer of the anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, the most corrupt institution in the Philippines is the Philippine National Police. The survey covered approximately 114,000 respondents in 107 countries, with 69% of the respondents voting for the PNP as the most corrupt (Romero, 2013).

                    Low salaries of cops are deemed to be the leading cause of police corruption. Joel D. Adriano stated in Asia Times that,  â€œSalaries of cops are not commensurate with the risks they face. A low-ranking police officer makes only 12,500 pesos (US$290) a month and approximately 60 percent of the police force is estimated to live below the poverty line. Many live in squatter settlements and cannot afford to send their children to school, according to a recent study by the University of the Philippines and the CORPS Foundation. Half of the police officers they surveyed said that they have no bank savings. Lean economics "leaves members of the police force vulnerable to corruption, bribery, and criminal activities", according to Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a global consulting firm."
