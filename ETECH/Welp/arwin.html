                <h3> 
                    The ZTE case has tested the Philippines’ relations with China, which Arroyo aggressively pursued. Aquino appears more lukewarm to Beijing amid a resurgence in territorial tensions over disputed islands in the South China Sea.

                    When the scandal broke, ZTE denied paying any kickbacks, and there were concerns that the contract’s cancellation would adversely affect China’s investments in the Philippines. Aquino’s administration has also put on hold another flagship of China's investment, a railway project in the northern Philippines, on suspicion it was overpriced because of kickbacks.
                    
                    Jose Miguel “Mike” Arroyo, who was seen as a backroom operator during his wife’s troubled nine years in office, posted bail later Tuesday to avoid detention. He had been indicted on bribery charges in December.
                    
                    He is accused of accepting money to push through a $330 million government contract with Chinese telecommunication company ZTE Corp. to set up a nationwide broadband network in 2007. The contract was originally priced at $130 million.
                    
                    The graft case dates back to 2007 and involves the Chinese telecommunications company, the ZTE Corporation.
                    
                    Mr. Arroyo, more commonly known as Mike, is accused of accepting bribes to have a $330m government contract with ZTE, even though it was originally priced at $130m.
                    
                    As president, Mrs. Arroyo initially approved the deal, but she later backtracked under huge public pressure.
                    
                    This is Mrs. Arroyo's second charge since leaving office in 2010. In February, she pleaded not guilty to electoral fraud over accusations that she rigged a 2007 election in favor of her candidates.
