                <h3> 
                    According to a survey by the Hong Kong-based Political & Economic Risk Consultancy released in 2010, the Philippines ranked as the 4th most corrupt out of 16 major Asia-Pacific investment destinations.
                    <br>
                    The Philippines ranked as the first most corrupt during 2008 and placed 6th in 2009, with a score of 7.0.
                    <br>
                    This survey of Hong Kong's PERC polled 2,714 middle, senior, and expatriate business executives in Asia, Australia, and the United States.
                    <br>
                    The survey states how corruption affects a country's government. The survey also shows how difficult it is to deal with corruption, especially since the corrupt people are somehow the people who are leading the country. 
                    <br>
                    Examples are politicians and civil servants. The lower the score the less chance of the country being corrupt. Higher scores may hint that the people who are leading the country may be corrupt.
