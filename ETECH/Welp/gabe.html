                <h3> 
                    A growing corruption scandal entangled a swath of Manila's political elite as dozens of politicians were accused of being linked to the theft of $229 million in Philippines taxpayer money. The scandal centers on Janet Lim Napoles, a businesswoman who says she was part of a scheme in which dummy nongovernmental organizations were formed between 2004 and 2010 to siphon off $229 million for herself and her accomplices. Trefor Moss (2014).

                    Janet Lim Napoles was accused by the Department of Justice of setting up fake non-government organizations that, since 2007, received lawmakers' pork barrel funds and then routed the money back to them. The whistleblower, a former associate of Napoles, testified to the Senate in a public hearing that the businesswoman received so much cash she would stash it in the bathtub of her luxury Manila home. Napoles denied involvement in the scheme and said her wealth came from her family's investments.
                    
                    Napoles said she had given money to 120 current and former lawmakers. A list of alleged accomplices was released by the Senate committee investigating the matter, prompting declarations of innocence across the board, including from Secretary for Budget and Management Florencio Abad. Ms. Napoles's lawyer said his client is not maintaining her innocence, but she is saying that she did not invent it; that it was already there when she joined in.
                    
                    The scandal first came to light in July after a whistleblower told the Justice Department that he had served as a bag man in transactions between politicians, Ms. Napoles, and others.
                    
                    The pork-barrel case had focused on three senators: Juan Ponce Enrile, the Senate minority leader; Jinggoy Estrada, the son of former President Joseph Estrada; and Ramon Revilla Jr., who declared himself a candidate for president in 2016. In September 2013, the Justice Department filed charges with the ombudsman against the three men, as well as five House members and 30 other individuals, including Ms. Napoles. All those accused, except Ms. Napoles, have denied any wrongdoing.
