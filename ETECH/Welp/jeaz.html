                <h4> 
                    A former senior state official told a Senate inquiry into corruption that contracts with the Philippine government are usually overpriced by at least 20 percent to facilitate kickbacks. Manny Mogato of Reuters wrote: "In emotional evidence, Rodolfo Lozada repeated previous allegations that the Philippines's top election officer claimed $ 130 million when she was cut for a final $ 329 million telecommunications with China's ZTE, double
the usual reback." (Mogato, 2008).

Lozada then stated that " The whole problem began when the chairman Abalos wanted to protect $ 130 million in the project." He then pointed out that it was too high and suggested another price. But later on, he was forced to resign as election commissioner.
